Project Overview: Military Inventory Management System

This project is a comprehensive Military Inventory Management System modeled on the organizational structure of the United States Armed Forces. It focuses on the three primary branches: the Army, Air Force, and Navy. Each of these main branches is further divided into four specialized sub-branches to reflect the real-world operational hierarchy.

The system offers robust functionality, allowing users to:

1)-View the complete inventory of each branch and sub-branch

2)-Add, delete, and retrieve equipment records efficiently

3)-Track and manage equipment details such as type, status, location, and more

The database operations are seamlessly integrated with a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) developed using Windows Forms. This ensures that users, regardless of technical expertise, can interact with the system intuitively and effectively.

By combining solid database design with a functional GUI, the project delivers a practical solution for military inventory tracking and management.
